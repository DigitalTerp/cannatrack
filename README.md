# My Canna Tracker ‚Äî Next.js + TypeScript + Firebase

> _In the Jedi Order, constructing your first lightsaber marks the completion of training._  
> _This repo is my first lightsaber‚Äîmy initiation into modern frontend development._

A **personalizable** web app for logging cannabis sessions, organizing cultivars, searching your history, and spotting patterns that reflect **your** preferences and routines. Built to stay out of your way and make it effortless to capture what matters.

---

## Features

- **Session Logging (fast & flexible)**  
  Capture method, weight (g), auto-timestamp, rating, notes, plus structured **Effects / Smell / Taste** fields‚Äîso your logs are both consistent and expressive.

- **Cultivar Library (auto-upserting)**  
  Your library grows automatically from session logs. Store **name, type (Indica/Sativa/Hybrid), cultivator, lineage, THC/THCA/CBD** and reuse across sessions.

- **Smart Autofill**  
  Select a previously logged cultivar and key fields (type, cultivator, potency) **auto-populate** to keep entries consistent and fast.

- **Search (History & Library)**  
  - **History Search:** filter past sessions by **cultivar name, notes, method, rating, or date**.  
  - **Library Search:** find cultivars by **name, type, cultivator, or lineage**.  
  Client-side, debounced, and keyboard-friendly.

- **Daily Tracker**  
  A today-at-a-glance view with clear type badges and quick actions.

- **History Navigation**  
  Jump via **calendar picker** or **Prev / Today / Next**. Edit/delete inline.

- **Insights (early analytics)**  
  Simple trends like **totals/means by method, weight, rating**‚Äîa foundation for richer analytics.

- **Mobile-First, Responsive UI**  
  Built for thumbs: large tap targets, native mobile inputs, accessible contrast, and a clean hamburger nav. Looks great on desktop; **optimized for phones**.

- **Auth & Data**  
  Email/Password via Firebase Auth, user-scoped collections in Firestore.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Firebase**  
  - Authentication (Email/Password)  
  - **Cloud Firestore** (user-scoped collections)
- **Styling**: Custom global CSS + **Plus Jakarta Sans**
- **Utilities**: **date-fns** for time formatting

---

The app auto-upserts cultivars from logs, and autofills session fields when you pick an existing cultivar.

## Architecture Notes

- **Search (History & Library)**  App Router with client components where interactivity matters (forms, history controls, search inputs).

Search is client-side and debounced for snappy filtering in History & Library.

Day math helpers (e.g., startOfTodayMs()) keep daily grouping consistent.

Type safety via Entry, StrainType, etc., so refactors are predictable.

## Roadmap

- **Richer Insights**

## Why I Built This

As a judge and a tinkerer, I wanted a tracker that adapts to me‚Äîfast to log, easy to search, and expressive enough to capture what actually matters: how it smelled, how it tasted, how it felt, and whether it‚Äôs worth revisiting.

Training complete. First lightsaber constructed. Time to explore the galaxy (of cultivars)‚Äîone personalized log at a time.

## *** Updates

## Cultivar and Product Page Update ‚Äî 2025-10-02

### Cultivar Page Overhaul
- Each cultivar now has a **dedicated product page**:
  - View detailed information about the cultivar (lineage, flavors, aromas, effects, notes).
  - Track **past sessions** with consumption data (method, weight, potency, rating, date).
  - See **statistics** such as average rating, total consumption, and session counts.
  - Access **purchase history**, separated into **active** and **archived purchases** with spend tracking.
  - View **cultivator breakdowns**, showing which brands you‚Äôve tried for that cultivar, with aggregated ratings and potency stats.

### Main Cultivar Library
- Gave the **main Cultivars list** a cleaner, more consistent look:
  - Dedicated columns for **Cultivar | Type | Lineage | Added | Actions** on desktop.
  - Tighter, more compact rows for mobile.
  - Type badge now shows **next to the cultivar name on mobile** for readability.

### Codebase Adjustments
- Adjusted `firestore.ts` queries to support fetching session data, purchase history, and legacy name lookups.
- Cleaned up old helpers and improved code consistency.
- Minor **visual refinements** for spacing, typography, and badge styling.


## Purchase Tracker Update ‚Äî 2025-09-26

We gave purchases the glow-up they deserve üéâ  
Here‚Äôs a quick, human-friendly tour of what changed and why it‚Äôs nice to use.

---

### The big idea
You can now track **what you bought**, **how much you used**, **when you finished it**, and **what it cost**‚Äîall in one clean flow. When you log sessions, your active purchase **counts down automatically**. When you‚Äôre done, you can **Finish & Archive** with one click.

---

### What you‚Äôll notice first
- **Purchases page (`/purchases`)**
  - Cards are centered, roomier, and mobile-friendly.
  - Each card shows **Potency**, **Purchased date**, **Spent**, and **$/g** in tidy pills.
  - A slick progress bar shows how much you have left.
  - Buttons match the site‚Äôs vibe (including a new blue **`.btn-secondary`** style).

- **Finish & Archive**
  - Marks the purchase **Depleted**, writes a historical snapshot, and removes it from ‚Äúactive.‚Äù
  - The archived item shows up in **Purchase History** views.

- **Purchase History (last 30 days)**
  - The `PurchaseHistory` component now only shows the **past 30 days**, centered with bigger summary pills:
    - **Past Purchases** ¬∑ **Spent** ¬∑ **Purchased** (auto-converts g ‚Üí oz at 28g+).
  - Dates are shown as **MM-DD-YYYY** across purchase UI.

- **History page (`/history`)**
  - Added a **Finished Purchases** section with its own **month navigator** (Prev / This / Next).
  - Totals bar for **Purchases**, **Spent**, and **Purchased** for the selected month.
  - You can remove archive entries here too.

---

### Under the hood (but still human)
- **Auto-deduction:** logging a session reduces remaining grams on the related purchase so inventory stays honest.
- **Archive entries:** saved to `users/{uid}/entries` with:
  - `journalType: 'purchase-archive'`, `isPurchaseArchive: true`, `hiddenFromDaily: true`
  - `purchaseId` (links back to the original)
  - Finished timestamps (`purchaseFinishedDateISO` / `purchaseFinishedAtMs`) and a snapshot of grams/cost/date.
- **No more duplicates:** we merge the canonical archive and legacy hidden entries and de-dupe them by ID.
- **Firestore-safe writes:** we strip `undefined` before writing, so rules stay happy.

---

### Pages & components we touched
- `app/purchases/page.tsx` ‚Äî grouped by **Type** with the same **typeBadge** style (sized like our summary pills and labeled ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù).
- `app/purchases/[id]/edit/page.tsx` ‚Äî hydrates purchase data; styles match the new forms.
- `components/PurchaseCard.tsx` ‚Äî new layout, centered name, info pills, progress gradient.
- `components/PurchaseHistory.tsx` ‚Äî 30-day view, larger summary pills, centered cards.
- `app/history/page.tsx` ‚Äî keeps daily sessions and now includes **Finished Purchases** with a month picker.
- **Landing page** ‚Äî highlights the new Purchase Tracker (edibles info is still there, just not the headline).

---

### Styling polish
- Moved stray inline styles into CSS Modules for consistency.
- Ensured light/dark mode keep the **same sizes** (no shrinking pills in dark mode).
- New secondary button you‚Äôll see in a few places:
  ```css
  .btn-secondary { background: #3b82f6; color: #fff; border-color: #2563eb; }
  .btn-secondary:hover { background: #2563eb; }

**September 17, 2025** 

### Forms & UI Enhancements
- **CSS Cleanup & Consistency**  
  - Introduced a shared `FormEntry.module.css` to unify styles across both **Add Entry** and **Edit Entry** forms.  
  - Removed duplicate inline styles and migrated to consistent CSS classes.  
  - Improved field spacing for better readability and usability.  

- **Personalization**  
  - Both forms now use the `niceName()` const from the tracker page to display a personalized greeting (e.g., ‚ÄúHi, Keith!‚Äù).  
  - Edit form header updated to show **cultivar name** or edible entry name directly in the page title for clearer context.  

- **Mobile Responsiveness**  
  - Centered forms and action buttons on small screens.  
  - Fixed button sizing so **primary** and **ghost** buttons now scale consistently.  
  - Adjusted grids to collapse more gracefully for mobile users.

- **UI Tweaks**  
  - Added breathing room between fields to avoid cramped layouts.  
  - Improved alignment of headers and inline action buttons (Back/Cancel).  
  - Simplified redundant form headers (e.g., replaced ‚ÄúLog Session‚Äù with personalized or contextual alternatives).

### Insights Page Improvements
- **Weight Conversion Helper**  
  - Added `formatWeightGraph()` , `formatWeightTotal()`, and `G_PER_OZ` constants to convert **28 g = 1 oz**.  
  - Tooltips and badges now display weights as **oz (g)** once totals exceed 28 grams.  

- **UI & CSS Enhancements**  
  - Improved chart readability with spacing, font sizing, and tooltips.  
  - Updated styles to be more visually balanced and easier to scan.  

- **Ordering & Clarity**  
  - Re-ordered **Consumption Method** chart categories alphabetically.  
  - Adjusted **Cultivar Type Consumed** 

---

These changes bring a more polished, consistent, and personalized experience across session logging and insights, while making the data easier to read and understand at a glance.
