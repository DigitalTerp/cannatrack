# My Canna Tracker ‚Äî Next.js + TypeScript + Firebase

> _In the Jedi Order, constructing your first lightsaber marks the completion of training._  
> _This repo is my first lightsaber‚Äîmy initiation into modern frontend development._

A **personalizable** web app for logging cannabis sessions, organizing cultivars, searching your history, and spotting patterns that reflect **your** preferences and routines. Built to stay out of your way and make it effortless to capture what matters.

---

## Features

- **Session Logging (fast & flexible)**  
  Capture method, weight (g), auto-timestamp, rating, notes, plus structured **Effects / Smell / Taste** fields‚Äîso your logs are both consistent and expressive.

- **Cultivar Library (auto-upserting)**  
  Your library grows automatically from session logs. Store **name, type (Indica/Sativa/Hybrid), cultivator, lineage, THC/THCA/CBD** and reuse across sessions.

- **Smart Autofill**  
  Select a previously logged cultivar and key fields (type, cultivator, potency) **auto-populate** to keep entries consistent and fast.

- **Search (History & Library)**  
  - **History Search:** filter past sessions by **cultivar name, notes, method, rating, or date**.  
  - **Library Search:** find cultivars by **name, type, cultivator, or lineage**.  
  Client-side, debounced, and keyboard-friendly.

- **Daily Tracker**  
  A today-at-a-glance view with clear type badges and quick actions.

- **History Navigation**  
  Jump via **calendar picker** or **Prev / Today / Next**. Edit/delete inline.

- **Insights (early analytics)**  
  Simple trends like **totals/means by method, weight, rating**‚Äîa foundation for richer analytics.

- **Mobile-First, Responsive UI**  
  Built for thumbs: large tap targets, native mobile inputs, accessible contrast, and a clean hamburger nav. Looks great on desktop; **optimized for phones**.

- **Auth & Data**  
  Email/Password via Firebase Auth, user-scoped collections in Firestore.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Firebase**  
  - Authentication (Email/Password)  
  - **Cloud Firestore** (user-scoped collections)
- **Styling**: Custom global CSS + **Plus Jakarta Sans**
- **Utilities**: **date-fns** for time formatting

The app auto-upserts cultivars from logs, and autofills session fields when you pick an existing cultivar.

## Architecture Notes

- **Search (History & Library)**  App Router with client components where interactivity matters (forms, history controls, search inputs).

Search is client-side and debounced for snappy filtering in History & Library.

Day math helpers (e.g., startOfTodayMs()) keep daily grouping consistent.

Type safety via Entry, StrainType, etc., so refactors are predictable.

## Roadmap

- **Richer Insights** (per-method breakdowns, cultivar scoring, dose totals by time of day)

- **CSV Import/Export**

- **Tagging & Advanced Filters** (sessions & cultivars)

- **Favorites / Pinning** (Quick access to go-to cultivars)

- **User Settings** (Default method/dose, preferred units)

- **Optional Photos/Gallery** Per session


I‚Äôll keep adding features and sanding off rough edges. Ideas welcome‚Äîopen an issue.

## Why I Built This

As a judge and a tinkerer, I wanted a tracker that adapts to me‚Äîfast to log, easy to search, and expressive enough to capture what actually matters: how it smelled, how it tasted, how it felt, and whether it‚Äôs worth revisiting.

Training complete. First lightsaber constructed. Time to explore the galaxy (of cultivars)‚Äîone personalized log at a time.
